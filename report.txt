**********************************USAGE************************************

gcc -o pwordcount pwordcount.c functions.child
./pwordcount text.txt

**********************************SUMMARY*********************************

--main(): 
This program creates a parent and child process and allows parallel processing
by utilizing pipes as a form of communication. The parent process reads a text 
file and sends the contents of the file to the child process. The child process 
reads the number of words and returns the count to the parent process. 

--readfile(): opens and loads the content of a text file and returns a pointer 
to the contents stored in the file. Argument is a pointer to the file (*filename)

--count_words(): utilizes a for loop to count the number of words and returns 
an integer. Argument is a pointer to the contents saved (*msg)

*************************************DESIGN********************************

The main file (pwordcount) contains the forked process and the pipe 
interactions. The sub file (functions) contains the functions not a part of the
interaction between the two processes (readfile & count_words)
